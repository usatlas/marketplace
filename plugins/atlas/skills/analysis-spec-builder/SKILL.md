    Use when producing a structured ATLAS analysis specification document:
    formalizing an analysis design into a specification.md file, documenting
    signal/control/validation regions, background methods, systematic
    uncertainties, and statistical model choices, or when the
    atlas-analysis-architect agent needs to write its output to disk.

# Analysis Specification Builder

## Overview

This is a workflow skill — not a library. It guides the production of a structured `specification.md` document that serves as the blueprint for an ATLAS physics analysis. A good specification is detailed enough for a graduate student to execute and a physics group convener to sign off on.

## When to Use

- After `atlas-analysis-architect` has designed an analysis and needs to write output
- When a user asks to document an analysis design they have already thought through
- When creating the input for `atlas-analysis-coder` (which reads `specification.md` before writing code)
- For internal notes, preliminary results, or paper-level analysis blueprints

## Template

Write `specification.md` with the following sections. Fill every section — a missing section is a flag for the convener.

```markdown
# Analysis Specification: <Physics Title>

**Status:** Draft | Preliminary | Final  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Authors:** <names>

---

## 1. Physics Motivation

<1–3 paragraphs: what is the signal, why is it interesting, what are the
existing experimental results (cite ATLAS/CMS papers), what is the expected
sensitivity, what luminosity and collision energy are targeted>

---

## 2. Datasets

### Data
| Campaign | Luminosity | GRL |
|---|---|---|
| Run 2 (2015–2018) | 139 fb⁻¹ | GRL_data18_13TeV_... |

### MC Samples
| Process | Generator | DSID range | Campaign | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Signal (WW→lνlν) | Sherpa 2.2.11 | 364250–364255 | mc20e | ... |
| ttbar | Powheg+Pythia8 | 410470 | mc20a/c/e | inclusive |

All containers verified in AMI with `--data-type DAOD_PHYSLITE`.

## 3. Framework and Software

| Component | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ntupling | TopCPToolkit vX.Y | standard object selection |
| Analysis | Python / coffea | reads NTuples produced above |
| Statistics | pyhf + cabinetry | HistFactory JSON workspace |
| ATLAS release | AthAnalysis, 25.2.X | or AnalysisBase |

---

## 4. Object Selection

### Jets
- Collection: `AnalysisJets` (PHYSLITE) / `AntiKt4EMPFlowJets` (PHYS)
- pT > 25 GeV, |η| < 2.5
- JVT > 0.5 for pT < 60 GeV, |η| < 2.4
- CP tool: `JetCalibTool` + `JetUncertaintiesTool`

### Electrons
- WP: `TightLH` + gradient isolation
- pT > 27 GeV, |η_cluster| < 2.47, excluding 1.37–1.52
- CP tool: `EgammaCalibrationAndSmearingTool`

### Muons
- WP: `Medium` + FCLoose isolation
- pT > 27 GeV, |η| < 2.5
- CP tool: `MuonCalibrationAndSmearingTool`

### b-jets
- WP: DL1dv01 at 77% efficiency
- CP tool: `BTaggingEfficiencyTool`

### Overlap Removal
Order: electrons → muons → jets (AntiKt4 ΔR < 0.2 e-jet, ΔR < 0.4 jet-e/μ)

## 5. Region Definitions

### Signal Region (SR)
| Cut | Value | Motivation |
|---|---|---|
| Njets | ≥ 4 | require hadronic activity |
| Nb-jets | ≥ 2 | suppress W+jets |
| MET | > 200 GeV | reduce QCD |
| ... | | |

Expected yields (pre-fit): S = XX ± YY, B = ZZ ± WW (stat. only)

### Control Region: ttbar (CR_top)
<Definition, expected purity, statistics>

### Control Region: W+jets (CR_Wjets)
<Definition>

### Validation Region (VR_top)
<Definition — orthogonal to CR, between CR and SR in MET>

---

## 6. Background Estimation

| Background | Method | Region | Purity |
|---|---|---|---|
| ttbar | MC normalized in CR_top | CR_top | ~85% |
| W+jets | MC normalized in CR_Wjets | CR_Wjets | ~70% |
| Multi-jet | Data-driven matrix method | dedicated loose SR | — |
| Diboson | MC (normalization free in fit) | — | — |

---

## 7. Systematic Uncertainties

### Experimental (NPs constrained to Gaussian)
- JES (23 components, 3 leading): ±1–5%
- JER (8 components): ±1–3%
- b-tagging efficiency (eigenvectors): ±1–5% per jet
- Lepton efficiency, energy scale/resolution: ±0.5–2%
- MET soft-term: ±5%
- Pile-up reweighting: ±5%
- Luminosity: ±1.5% (Run 2)

### Modelling
- ttbar generator: Powheg+H7 vs Powheg+P8 comparison
- ttbar shower: Powheg+P8 vs Sherpa 2.2.11
- Signal QCD scale: envelope of μ_R, μ_F variations
- Signal PDF: PDF4LHC15 eigenvectors

---

## 8. Statistical Model

- Framework: pyhf (HistFactory JSON) via cabinetry
- Fit type: profile likelihood, background-only for exclusion
- POI: signal strength μ
- Regions in fit: SR + CR_top + CR_Wjets simultaneously
- NP treatment: correlated across regions where applicable
- MC stat. uncertainty: Barlow-Beeston lite
- Test statistic: CLs (for exclusion limits)

---

## 9. Unblinding Checklist

- [ ] MC modelling validated in VRs against data
- [ ] Background-only fit in CRs converges, pulls < 1σ
- [ ] Expected limits match Asimov estimate within 10%
- [ ] Paper draft reviewed by physics group
- [ ] SR unblinded

## 10. Timeline and Milestones

| Milestone | Target date |
|---|---|
| NTuple production complete | YYYY-MM-DD |
| CR/VR validation | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Results to physics group | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Paper submission | YYYY-MM-DD |
```

## Quality Checks

Before finalising `specification.md`:
- Every dataset container verified in AMI (not just assumed to exist)
- Every object WP has a corresponding CP tool and scale factor
- SR and all CRs are mutually orthogonal
- Each background has a method — "MC" alone is not a method unless normalized somewhere
- Systematics list covers all objects used in the analysis
